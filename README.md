**Project Title: Geographic Data Analysis for New York City**

**Project Overview:**

This project focuses on performing comprehensive geographic data analysis for New York City (NYC) by integrating and processing various datasets. The primary objectives are to analyze and visualize patterns, trends, and insights related to different aspects of the city, such as 311 service requests, street tree data, and real estate information.

**Project Components:**

1. **311 Service Requests Analysis:**
   - Download and preprocess NYC 311 service requests data.
   - Clean and structure the data to identify relevant trends and patterns.
   - Visualize service request distribution, types, and resolution times.
   - Identify hotspots and common issues reported by residents.

2. **Street Tree Data Analysis:**
   - Download and preprocess NYC street tree data.
   - Perform data cleaning and exploration to understand the distribution and health of street trees.
   - Visualize tree density, health status, and species distribution across different neighborhoods.
   - Identify correlations between tree health, location, and environmental factors.

3. **Real Estate Market Analysis:**
   - Download and preprocess Zillow real estate market data for NYC.
   - Clean and structure the data to focus on relevant features.
   - Visualize real estate trends, property values, and market hotspots.
   - Analyze the correlation between tree density, service requests, and real estate values.

4. **Integration and Cross-Analysis:**
   - Combine and integrate the cleaned datasets for a holistic view of NYC.
   - Perform cross-analysis to identify relationships and correlations between different datasets.
   - Visualize and interpret geographical patterns that emerge from the integrated data.

**Tools and Technologies:**

- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** Pandas, GeoPandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and so on
- **Data Visualization:** Maps, Charts, Graphs
- **Data Sources:** NYC Open Data, Zillow API, nyc_zipcodes

**Expected Deliverables:**

- Cleaned and preprocessed datasets for 311 service requests, street tree data, and real estate information.
- Interactive visualizations showcasing geographic patterns and trends.
- Correlation analyses between different aspects of NYC data.
- Comprehensive project documentation detailing data sources, cleaning processes, and analysis results.

**Project Impact:**

This project aims to provide valuable insights into the geographical dynamics of NYC by leveraging open data sources. The analyses conducted will contribute to a better understanding of urban dynamics, assist in urban planning, and potentially inform decision-making processes related to city services, real estate development, and environmental conservation.
